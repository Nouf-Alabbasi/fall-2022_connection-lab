I explored the <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/puzzle-party">"Puzzle Party"</a> google experiment.
I think that it is a really cool idea to allow people to solve puzzles online together. The player is able to select a puzzle and share the link to that puzle with as many people as possible. </br>

The peieces can be moved win groups and as individual peieces,</br>

peices attach together even if it is the wrong peice,</br>

and the peieces move in real time in each player's screen which mimics solving a puzzle in person with friends and family.
they also had a great selection of puzzles in diffent levels. There are also features such as dark mode, a preview of the puzzle.

The interface is very simple, intuitive and to the point, the first page the player is faced with a scroll page with many puzzles, the user can pick a different difficulty and be directed to another page with appropriate puzzles. The puzzle page doesn't have way too many buttons or features, just the deemed necessary. This makes it easy for new users to navigate the site which makes it easy to share the link with new users and play together.</br>

all these features make this experiment really enjoyable and adaptable to different people. One thing though is that when peieces of a puzzle are attached to the wrong peice there are indicators such as the peieces not attaching smoothly, or there being gaps because of the wrong shape of the peieces, but there arn't any indicators are not present in the online version which is an dincovnivence.</br>
There is also no search feature. if a user wants a specific puzzle, the user would need to keep scrolling until they find it. However, I see the point of not adding a search bar if the goal of the site to be a casual game site and a search bar would add unecessary features. It might also be intresting to be able to uplaod our own pictures an turn them to puzzles.


<!-- 
pros:
easy to navigate/very intituitve, keeping in mind that the link is usually to new users
mimics real life

cons:
there is no indicator that the puzzle peieces are attached wrong
no search (makes it good for casual play, but not if you want to solve a specific puzzle) (but a scroll might be unnecessary
