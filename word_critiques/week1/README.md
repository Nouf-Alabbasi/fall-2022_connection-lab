I explored the <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/puzzle-party">"Puzzle Party"</a> google experiment.
I think that it is a really cool idea to allow people to solve puzzles online together. </br>

The peieces can be moved win groups and as individual peieces,</br>

peices attach together even if it is the wrong peice,</br>

and the peieces move in real time in each player's screen which mimics solving a puzzle in person with friends and family.
they also had a great selection of puzzles in diffent levels

</p>
all these features make this experiment really enjoyable and adaptable to different people. One thing though is that when peieces of a puzzle are attached to the wrong peice there are indicators such as the peieces not attaching smoothly, or there being gaps because of the wrong shape of the peieces, but there arn't any indicators are not present in the online version which is an dincovnivence.</br>
