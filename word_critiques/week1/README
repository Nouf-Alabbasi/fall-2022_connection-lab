I explored the "Puzzle Party" google experiment.
I think that it is a really cool idea to allow people to solve puzzles online together. The peieces can be moved win groups and as individual peieces, peices attach together even if it is the wrong peice, and the peieces move in real time in each player's screen which mimics solving a puzzle in person with friends and family.
