### documentation <br>
To start off this project I started by looking up wireframes to get layout ideas<br>
I tried out this layout. the back button is at the left down corner. the title is in a container to the right and to the left of that is a container containing the project demo and it's description. this layout reminded of linkedin or facebook profiles.

</p>

but I wanted to try to keep the project as the center of attenction so I moved this around and came up with the second layout. The title is at the bottom right, and the project and the description is in the middle. This reminded me of how things are displayed at art gallaries.

</p>
This is how the final website looks like.
